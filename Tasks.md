## (a) Subtask1: 2 player maze game 
This can be Pacman kind of maze game where the two players compete in time taking turn alternately in playing pacman or play simultaneously in side by side separate screens. Think of a way to give points to the players and a win/loss criteria. Or maybe one player controls pacman and the other player moves around the monsters trying to block pacman until a timeout. Generate a new random maze for each gameplay, so that the players don't get used to the maze structure on multiple games and get bored. This is just a sample 2 player maze game. You can think of your own game using a maze and build it.

Focus on cool and fun look of the game. Smooth controls. Appropriate message when network between the players is slow. Use sound effects. Get your TA addicted to play it for > x minutes with you. Bonus points if you come up with your own 2 player maze game to build instead of 2 player pacman. Minimum requirement: single player pacman which is not copied from Internet.


## (b) Subtask2: A maze simulation 
Remember the COL106 endsem question where the largest possible Ironman droid had to reach T from S in a maze? You can modify that problem to create a maze and place the 6 infinity stones in different locations. A droid has not only to reach from S to T, but also pick all the stones on its route. Think of the algorithmic changes you might need to visit the stones. The shortest path from S to T might not include the places containing the stones. After picking a particular stone your droid might need to backtrack, as the way ahead after the stone is a deadend. If you define your maze as a graph, then visiting all nodes in the graph is called Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Visiting a subset of nodes in the graph (the stone locations) is called Steiner TSP, and the special nodes Steiner nodes. Think/read whether you can optimally solve this problem, and if not then what heuristic will you use? Also can your droid see the whole maze at all times? Or is it only seeing in first person based on its current location? This is just a sample computer simulation. You can think of your own problem using a maze and solve it algorithmically.

Focus on algorithmically interesting mapping of the simulation. Try to understand correctness and runtime if possible. Check smoothness of simulation, as without human control, the drone shouldn't do everything in a microsecond which is not even visible. Put appropriate delays so that the animation is aesthetic to watch. Bonus points if you come up with your own problem to solve. Minimum requirement: simulation of exactly the COL106 major problem.
